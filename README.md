# Neural Nets and Flying Saucers

This is a repository for my talk on adversarial AI/ML using the UFO Reporting System.

## Getting Started

If you're here, you were likely at one of my talks and want the slides, or you want to start tinkering with some of the demos. Either way I got you covered.

## Navigating the Repo 

All of the accompanying materials (slides, outline, notes) for each talk can be found in their respective folders above.
